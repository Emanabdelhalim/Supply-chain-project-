# Smart Supply Chain for Big Data Analysis

## **Overview**
This project analyzes supply chain operations using big data techniques to optimize logistics, inventory management, and overall efficiency. The insights generated aim to support businesses in making data-driven decisions.

## **Objectives**
- Optimize supply chain processes using big data techniques.
- Identify key metrics affecting supply chain performance.
- Provide actionable insights through visualizations and analysis.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization.
- **SQL Server 2022**: Database management and queries.
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
- **Excel**: Data preprocessing and analysis.

## **Data**
- The dataset contains information on inventory, logistics, customer demand, and supplier performance.
- **Source**: Proprietary data/Mock data (or specify the actual source if available).

## **Key Insights**
1. Supply chain inefficiencies can be identified by analyzing trends in delivery delays and inventory shortages.
2. Real-time tracking and data integration significantly improve decision-making.
3. Cost optimization is achievable by analyzing procurement and logistics metrics.

## **Features**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.
- Data visualization with Power BI and Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Advanced SQL queries for insights extraction.
